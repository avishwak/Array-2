# Problem 2: Game of Life https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/
# Time Complexity: O(m*n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode: Yes
# Explanation:
    # - We can solve this problem by using the input board itself to mark the changes.
    # - We iterate through the board and for each cell, we count the number of live neighbors using a function.
    # - Based on the count, we mark the cells that will change state using temporary values.
    # - Finally, we update the board to reflect the new states.

# the following code is the same as above but uses a different approach to mark the changes
# It uses a different marking strategy: Adds 2 or 2Ã—current value to encode next state.
